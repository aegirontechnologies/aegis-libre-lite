# AEGIS â€“ Open Socketed ARMv9 Platform

**AEGIS** is an open hardware initiative to bring modular, upgradeable ARMv9 CPUs to developers, builders, and secure infrastructure.

## ðŸ”§ What We're Building

- **LGA-socketed ARMv9 CPUs** â€“ From 8-core to 128-core designs, fully documented.
- **LGA-Z1 Socket** â€“ A new open CPU socket standard for ARM platforms.
- **Modular Motherboards** â€“ PCIe Gen4, DDR5, NVMe, USB, and expansion-ready.
- **BIEM Module** â€“ Behavioral enforcement chip that governs runtime execution, hardware access, and logs violations.
- **Nova TPU** â€“ A plug-and-play INT8/FP16 inference card for local AI execution.

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

Most ARM hardware today is locked down and soldered in. AEGIS gives developers and system integrators a **true upgrade path**, open documentation, and a trust-first foundation for embedded AI, edge computing, and resilient infrastructure.

## ðŸ“¦ Open Hardware Goals

- âœ… Public LGA socket spec (LGA-Z1)
- âœ… Full schematics and pinout documentation
- âœ… Modular firmware and PCIe-based expansion
- âœ… Support for third-party motherboards (ASUS, ASRock, etc.)

## ðŸ“‚ Status

- Provisional patents filed  
- Dev kits and socket specs in progress  
- Launching small-batch boards in 2025
